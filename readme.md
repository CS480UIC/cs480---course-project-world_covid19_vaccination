Most countries in the world are vaccinating against COVID-19. These countries get different kinds of vaccines. Each vaccine has a name, a type (inactivated or mRNA vaccine...), R&D companies, protection rates, and side effects. Each batch of vaccine has a batch number, production date, and manufacturing address. Each country counts the number of people that have been vaccinated in different areas. Each state divided into cities or counties, and each city or county has specific hospitals that perform the task. Each hospital will assign some departments to complete the task of vaccination. Each hospital will also set up vaccination sites in a different area. People who go to be vaccinated will have a unique ID, name, age, date of birth, address, and date of vaccination (including the first and second dates for a second shot if needed).
